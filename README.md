Hi, I'm Gabriel Naressi. I'm from Brazil and I've been programming since 2014. In my first (and actual) job at [Synchro](https://www.synchro.com.br), I started with frontend development with React and MobX as state control. I also contributed to some open source project of the compy that ended up discotinued ([Synchro-TEC](https://github.com/Synchro-TEC) :octocat:).

Throughout the years I worked a little with Grails (which forced me to learn the Groovy and MVC architecture) and also started developing backend applications with Spring Boot alongside frontend applications, which turned me into a fullstack developer.

Currently:

- ⚛️ I'm working with Reactjs/JavaScript (and TypeScript) + MobX as state control
- 🍃 I'm working with Spring Boot (Java) and Onion architecture.
- ✅ Work on tasks that involve:
  - 🐳 Docker
  - 🐘 Gradle
  - 💄 HTML, CSS
  - 💾 Relational databases (Oracle and PostgreSQL)
  - 🐱 Yarn, NPM and webpack
- 😻 I'm working with Gitlab, Gitflow and scrum process.
- 📚 I'm studying the stack: React, Redux and Typescript (I will soon be working on a project at [Synchro](https://www.synchro.com.br) with this stack).
- 🌱 I've been exploring Vue 3 and Vuex 4 with Typescript

Additional info about me:

- 🏠 I work remotely for more than 3 years.
