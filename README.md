My name is Gabriel. I've been programming since 2014. In my first job (and only job), I start with React and MobX (as state control). I worked a little with Grails (which forced me to learn the Groovy language). Later I started to work with Spring Boot applications with onion architecture and JUnit as a test tool. My activities were always involved with relational databases like PostgreSQL and Oracle.

Currently:

- Work as full stack at [Synchro](https://www.synchro.com.br):
  - ‚öõÔ∏è React + Mobx stack (now with Typescript)
  - üçÉ Spring Boot and Java
- :seedling: Studying React, Redux and Typescript because I will soon be working on a project with this stack.
- Working with Gitlab, Gitflow and scrum process.

Curiosities about me:

- I work remotely for more than 3 years.
- I like to study philosophy and I'm studying psychology.
- I like to learn about paranormal phenomena.
