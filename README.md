Hi, I'm Gabriel Naressi. I'm from Brazil and I've been programming since 2014. In my first job (and only job at [Synchro](https://www.synchro.com.br)), I start with React and MobX (as state control). In fact, my team started to create some open source projects that ended up discontinued. The org was: [Synchro-TEC](https://github.com/orgs/Synchro-TEC/dashboard) :octocat:.

I worked a little with Grails (which forced me to learn the Groovy language and MVC architecture).

Later I started to work with Spring Boot applications with onion architecture and JUnit as a test tool. Furthermore, my activities were always involved with relational databases like PostgreSQL and Oracle.

Currently I work with:

- ⚛️ Reactjs/JavaScript (and TypeScript) + MobX as state control
- 🍃 Spring Boot applications using Onion architecture and Java.
- ✅ Tasks involving:
  - 🐳 Docker
  - 🐘 Gradle
  - 💄 HTML, CSS
  - 💾 Relational databases (Oracle and PostgreSQL)
  - 🐱 Yarn, NPM and webpack
- 😻 Working with Gitlab, Gitflow and scrum process.
- 🌱 Studying React, Redux and Typescript (I will soon be working on a project with this stack).

Additional info about me:

- 🏠 I work remotely for more than 3 years.
- 🧠 I like to study philosophy.
- 🎓 I'm about to graduate in psycology.
- 👻 I am interested in anomalistic psychology.
- 💀 I like to study symbolism. There is my Instagram page (posts are in portuguese): [@dicio.simbolos](https://www.instagram.com/dicio.simbolos/)
